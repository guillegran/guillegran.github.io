<h1 class="title">A first idea of the cohomology of sheaves</h1>
<h2 class="author">Guillermo Gallego</h2>

</div>
<p>In this first entry I want to give a first notion of the cohomology of sheaves through Čech cohomology and try to show how cohomology appears in a natural way when studying sheaves.</p>
<h1 id="presheaves-and-sheaves" class="unnumbered">Presheaves and sheaves</h1>
<p>First, let us recall what was the definition of a sheaf. We start with a topological space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and consider the category <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Op}(X)\)</span> whose objects are open subsets <span class="math inline">\(U\subset X\)</span> and whose morphisms are given by set inclusions <span class="math inline">\(U\hookrightarrow V\)</span>. This is a particular example of a <em>site</em>, a category endowed with a <em>Grothendieck topology</em>. In general, sheaves are defined over sites, but for the sake of simplicity, we will stick to the category <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Op}(X)\)</span>.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Definition 1.</strong> A <em>presheaf</em> is a contravariant functor <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}:\mathrm{Op}(X) \rightarrow \mathrm{Set}\)</span>.<br />
More generally, if <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is a subcategory of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Set}\)</span> (for example the category of topological spaces, the category of groups or an abelian category) we say that a contravariant functor <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Op}(X) \rightarrow \mathcal{C}\)</span> is a <em><span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>-valued presheaf</em>. For example, we speak of a sheaf of topological spaces, a sheaf of groups, a sheaf of modules, etc.</p>
<p>Let us stop for a second and try to unravel the meaning of this definition. A presheaf is giving, for any open subset <span class="math inline">\(U\subset X\)</span> a set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(U)\)</span> associated to it and, for any inclusion <span class="math inline">\(V\hookrightarrow U\)</span> a <em>restriction morphism</em> <span class="math inline">\(r^U_V: \mathcal{F}(U) \rightarrow \mathcal{F}(V)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The most important example of presheaf is the <em>presheaf of continuous functions</em>. If <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a topological space and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is another topological space, we define the presheaf <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_X(-,Y)\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> given by <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{C}_X (U,Y) = \left\{ \text{Continuous maps } U\rightarrow Y \right\}.\]</span> The restriction morphisms of this presheaf are given, precisely, by restrictions <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  r^U_V :\mathcal{C}_X(U,Y)&amp;\longrightarrow \mathcal{C}_X(V,Y)\\ 
    f &amp;\longmapsto f|_V. 
  \end{aligned}\]</span> With this in mind, in general we are going to adopt the notation <span class="math inline">\(f|_V=r^U_V(f)\)</span> for any presheaf <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> and any <span class="math inline">\(f\in \mathcal{F}(U)\)</span>.</p>
<p>This presheaf has some extra good properties that we would like to have in general. The first property is known as <em>locality</em>, this means that if we cover any open subset <span class="math inline">\(U\subset X\)</span> by open sets, <span class="math inline">\(U=\bigcup_{i\in I} U_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s,t: U \rightarrow Y\)</span> are two functions that coincide on all of the <span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span>, that is <span class="math inline">\(s|_{U_i}=t|_{U_i}\)</span> for every <span class="math inline">\(i\in I\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(s=t\)</span>. The second property is known as <em>gluing</em>: if for every <span class="math inline">\(i \in I\)</span> we define some <span class="math inline">\(f_i:U_i \rightarrow Y\)</span> in such a way that they agree on the overlaps, that is <span class="math inline">\(f_i|_{U_i\cap U_j} = f_j|_{U_i \cap U_j}\)</span>, then there is some function <span class="math inline">\(f:U \rightarrow Y\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f|_{U_i} =f_i\)</span>. These two properties can be gathered in just one if we just add to the gluing condition that the obtained <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is unique. Thus, we define:</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Definition 2.</strong> A presheaf <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> is a <em>sheaf</em> if, for every open subset <span class="math inline">\(U\subset X\)</span>, given an open covering <span class="math inline">\(U=\bigcup_{i\in I} U_i\)</span> and a collection of elements <span class="math inline">\(s_i \in \mathcal{F}(U_i)\)</span> for every <span class="math inline">\(i\in I\)</span> such that, for every <span class="math inline">\(i,j \in I\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[s_i|_{U_i \cap U_j} = s_j|_{U_i \cap U_j},\]</span> there exists a unique <span class="math inline">\(s\in \mathcal{F}(U)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(s|_{U_i}=s_i\)</span> for every <span class="math inline">\(i\in I\)</span>.<br />
Let us see the sheaf condition in a different way. Consider a presheaf <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>, an open subset <span class="math inline">\(U\subset X\)</span> and an open covering <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{U}=\left\{ U_i: i \in I \right\}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, that is, <span class="math inline">\(U=\bigcup_{i \in I} U_i\)</span>. We define the set of <em>Čech <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-cochains of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{U}\)</span></em> as <span class="math display">\[C^0(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})=\prod_{i \in I} \mathcal{F}(U_i).\]</span> We also define the set of <em>Čech <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-cochains of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{U}\)</span></em> as <span class="math display">\[C^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})=\prod_{i&lt;j \in I} \mathcal{F}(U_i\cap U_j).\]</span> Elements of <span class="math inline">\(C^0(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\)</span> can be written as <span class="math inline">\((f_i)_{i\in I}\)</span> and elements of <span class="math inline">\(C^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\)</span> can be written as <span class="math inline">\((f_{ij})_{i&lt;j \in I}\)</span>. Now, given any open subset <span class="math inline">\(U\subset X\)</span>, the restriction maps induce natural maps <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    d_0: \mathcal{F}(U)&amp;\longrightarrow C^0(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\\ 
    f &amp;\longmapsto (f|_{U_i})_{i \in I}, 
    \end{aligned}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    d&#39;_1: C^0(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})&amp;\longrightarrow C^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\\ 
    (f_{i})_{i \in I} &amp;\longmapsto (f_i|_{U_i\cap U_j})_{i&lt;j \in I} , 
    \end{aligned}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    d_1&#39;&#39;: C^0(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})&amp;\longrightarrow C^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\\ 
    (f_{i})_{i \in I} &amp;\longmapsto (f_{j}|_{U_i \cap U_j})_{i&lt;j \in I}.
    \end{aligned}\]</span> Now, the sheaf condition can be restated as saying that for any open subset <span class="math inline">\(U\subset X\)</span> and any open covering <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{U}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, the map <span class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> is injective and the diagram <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{F}(U) \overset{d_0}{\hookrightarrow} C^0(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F}) \underset{d_1&#39;&#39;}{\overset{d_1&#39;}{\rightrightarrows}} C^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\]</span> is an equalizer. This means that <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{F}(U)= \left\{ f\in C^0(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F}): d_1&#39;(f)=d_1&#39;&#39;(f) \right\}.\]</span></p>
<p>Moreover, suppose now that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> is a sheaf of groups. Then since <span class="math inline">\(C^0(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\)</span> is defined as a product, it naturally inherits the structure of a group. On the other hand, <span class="math inline">\(C^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\)</span> is not in general a group, but it has a distinguished element <span class="math display">\[1=(1_{\mathcal{F}(U_i\cap U_j)})_{i&lt;j \in I},\]</span> where we are denoting by <span class="math inline">\(1_G\)</span> the identity element of a group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. We can also define the map <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    d_1: C^0(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})&amp;\longrightarrow C^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\\ 
    (f_{i})_{i \in I} &amp;\longmapsto (f_{i}|_{U_i \cap U_j}(f_{j}|_{U_i \cap U_j})^{-1})_{i&lt;j \in I}.
    \end{aligned}\]</span> In this situation, the sheaf condition is equivalent to saying that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(U)\)</span> is the kernel of this map, where by the kernel we obiously mean the preimage of the distinguished element. One can also write this as the fact that the following sequence is exact <span class="math display">\[1\rightarrow \mathcal{F}(U) \overset{d_0}{\rightarrow} C^0(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F}) \overset{d_1}{\rightarrow} C^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F}).\]</span></p>
<p>Before going on, we have to define in general what is a morphism of sheaves. This is very simple, it is just a natural transformation between the underlying presheaves. That is, if <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> are two sheaves, then a morphism of sheaves <span class="math inline">\(\varphi:\mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{G}\)</span> consists on maps <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_U: \mathcal{F}(U) \rightarrow \mathcal{G}(U)\)</span> for each open subset <span class="math inline">\(U\subset X\)</span> such that for every inclusion <span class="math inline">\(V\hookrightarrow U\)</span> the following diagram commutes</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{CD}
      \mathcal{F}(U) @&gt; \varphi_U &gt;&gt; \mathcal{G}(U) \\
      @VV r^U_{V} V   @VV r^U_{V} V \\
      \mathcal{F}(V) @&gt; \varphi_V &gt;&gt; \mathcal{G}(V).
    \end{CD}\]</span></p>
<p>If the sheaves involved are <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>-valued then we say that the morphism is a <em>morphism of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>-valued sheaves</em> if the <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_U\)</span> are morphisms of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Another important concept to know is that of the <em>stalk</em> of a sheaf at a point <span class="math inline">\(x\in X\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> is a sheaf on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x\in X\)</span>, we define the <em>stalk of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></em> as the direct limit <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{F}_x=\varinjlim_{x \in U} \mathcal{F}(U).\]</span> More precisely, we consider the set of pairs <span class="math inline">\((U,f)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> an open neighbourhood of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f\in \mathcal{F}(U)\)</span> and consider on it the equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\((U,f)\sim (V,g)\)</span> if there exists some open neighbourhood <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(W\subset U\cap V\)</span> and with <span class="math inline">\(f|_W =g|_W\)</span>. The stalk <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}_x\)</span> is then the set of equivalence classes.</p>
<h1 id="exact-sequences-of-sheaves" class="unnumbered">Exact sequences of sheaves</h1>
<p>Sheaf cohomology is defined (at least until degree <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>) in general for sheaves of groups. Therefore, all the sheaves that we are going to consider from now on are indeed sheaves of groups.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}\)</span> are sheaves of groups, we say that a sequence of morphisms of sheaves <span class="math display">\[\begin{CD}
    \mathcal{F} @&gt; \varphi &gt;&gt; \mathcal{G} @&gt; \psi &gt;&gt; \mathcal{H}
      \end{CD}\]</span> is <em>exact</em> at <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> if the induced sequence in the stalks <span class="math display">\[\begin{CD}
    \mathcal{F}_x @&gt; \varphi_x &gt;&gt; \mathcal{G}_x @&gt; \psi_x &gt;&gt; \mathcal{H}_x
      \end{CD}\]</span> is an exact sequence of groups at <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}_x\)</span>. That is, if <span class="math inline">\(\ker(\psi_x) = \mathrm{im}(\varphi_x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that exactness has been defined at the level of stalks, so we should not expect that exactness is preserved at a global level. That is, in general the sequence <span class="math display">\[\begin{CD}
    \mathcal{F}(X) @&gt; \varphi_X &gt;&gt; \mathcal{G}(X) @&gt; \psi_X &gt;&gt; \mathcal{H}(X)
      \end{CD}\]</span> will not be exact.</p>
<p>However, there is the following result:</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Proposition 1.</strong> <em>A short exact sequence of sheaves of groups on a topological space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span></em> <span class="math display">\[\begin{CD}
1 @&gt;&gt;&gt;  \mathcal{F} @&gt; i &gt;&gt; \mathcal{G} @&gt; \pi &gt;&gt; \mathcal{H} @&gt;&gt;&gt; 1,
      \end{CD}\]</span> <em>induces an exact sequence</em> <span class="math display">\[\begin{CD}
1 @&gt;&gt;&gt;  \mathcal{F}(U) @&gt; i_U &gt;&gt; \mathcal{G}(U) @&gt; \pi_U &gt;&gt; \mathcal{H}(U),
      \end{CD}\]</span> <em>for any open subset</em> <span class="math inline">\(U\subset X\)</span>.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Proof.</em> Consider <span class="math inline">\(f\in \mathcal{F}(U)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(i_U(f)=1\)</span>. For every <span class="math inline">\(x\in U\)</span> we have that <span class="math inline">\(i_x(f_x)=1\)</span> and, since <span class="math inline">\(i_x\)</span> is injective, <span class="math inline">\(f_x=1\)</span>. Since this is for every <span class="math inline">\(x\in X\)</span>, we have that <span class="math inline">\(f=1\)</span>. This proves that <span class="math inline">\(i_U\)</span> is injective and, consequently, that the sequence is exact at <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(U)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Take now <span class="math inline">\(f\in \mathcal{F}(U)\)</span>. For every <span class="math inline">\(x\in U\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(\pi_x(i_x(f_x))=1\)</span>, which implies that <span class="math inline">\(\pi_U(i_U(f))=1\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{im}\ i_U \subset \ker \pi_U\)</span>. On the other hand, if <span class="math inline">\(g\in \mathcal{G}(U)\)</span> is such that <span class="math inline">\(\pi_U(g)=1\)</span> then, for all <span class="math inline">\(x\in U\)</span>, we have that <span class="math inline">\(\pi_x(g_x)=1\)</span>. Therefore, there exists some <span class="math inline">\(f_x \in \mathcal{F}_x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(i_x(f_x)=g_x\)</span>. This implies that for every <span class="math inline">\(x\in U\)</span> there exists some open neighbourhood <span class="math inline">\(V\subset U\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_V \in \mathcal{F}(V)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(i_V(f_V)=g|_V\)</span>. Moreover, in an overlap <span class="math inline">\(V\cap W\)</span> we have <span class="math display">\[i_{V\cap W}( f_V|_{V\cap W})= g|_{V\cap W} = i_{V\cap W}(f_W|_{V\cap W})\]</span> and, since we already proved that <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> remains injective after passing to global elements, we have that <span class="math inline">\( f_V|_{V\cap W}=f_W|_{V\cap W}\)</span>. Therefore, the sheaf condition allows us to “glue” these elements to give an <span class="math inline">\(f \in \mathcal{F}(U)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f|_V=f_V\)</span> and satisfying that <span class="math inline">\(i_U(f_U)=g\)</span>. This proves that <span class="math inline">\(\ker \pi_U \subset \mathrm{im}\ i_U\)</span>, thus the sequence is exact at <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}(U)\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span>  <br />
There is now a natural question to ask ourselves. One should ask what is it that fails at <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}(U)\)</span>. Why <span class="math inline">\(\pi_U\)</span> is not in general surjective? What is the obstruction for the exactness to pass from the local setting to the global one. As we shall show, this obstruction is precisely given by sheaf cohomology.</p>
<p>Consider some element <span class="math inline">\(h\in \mathcal{H}(U)\)</span>. Then, since <span class="math inline">\(\pi_x\)</span> is surjective, for every <span class="math inline">\(x\in U\)</span> there exists some <span class="math inline">\(g_x \in \mathcal{G}_x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\pi_x(h_x)=g_x\)</span>. This implies that we can get an open covering <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{U}=\left\{ U_i: i \in I \right\}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and, for every <span class="math inline">\(i \in I\)</span>, an element <span class="math inline">\(g_i \in \mathcal{G}(U_i)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{U_i}(g_i)=h|_{U_i}\)</span>. Let us see now what happens in the overlaps. In general <span class="math inline">\(g_i|_{U_i\cap U_j} \neq g_j|_{U_i\cap U_j}\)</span>, so we cannot glue the <span class="math inline">\(g_i\)</span> to obtain a global element. The obstruction to this is the element <span class="math inline">\(g_i g_j^{-1} \in \mathcal{G}(U_i \cap U_j)\)</span>. However <span class="math display">\[\pi_{U_i \cap U_j}(g_ig_j^{-1})=hh^{-1} = 1.\]</span> Thus, there exists some element <span class="math inline">\(g_{ij} \in \mathcal{F}(U_i\cap U_j)\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[i_{U_i\cap U_j}(g_{ij})=g_ig_j^{-1}.\]</span> Gathering all these elements, we get a <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-cochain <span class="math inline">\((g_{ij})_{i&lt;j\in I} \in C^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\)</span>.</p>
<p>This cochain satisfies one extra property. Notice that <span class="math display">\[i_{U_i\cap U_j\cap U_k}(g_{ij} g_{jk} g_{ik}^{-1})=g_i g_j^{-1} g_j g_k^{-1} g_k g_i^{-1}= 1,\]</span> so, since <span class="math inline">\(i_{U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k}\)</span> is injective, <span class="math inline">\((g_{ij})_{i&lt;j \in I}\)</span> satisfies the <em>cocycle condition</em>: <span class="math display">\[g_{ij} g_{jk} g_{ik}^{-1} = 1\]</span> in <span class="math inline">\(U_i\cap U_j \cap U_k\)</span>, for every <span class="math inline">\(i&lt;j&lt;k \in I\)</span>. The set of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-cochains of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{U}\)</span> satisfying the cocycle condition is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(Z^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\)</span> and is called the set of <em>Čech <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-cocycles of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{U}\)</span></em>.</p>
<p>Naively, we would like to define a map <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}(U) \rightarrow Z^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\)</span> sending each <span class="math inline">\(h\in \mathcal{H}(U)\)</span> to the cocycle <span class="math inline">\((g_{ij})_{i&lt;j \in I}\)</span> constructed above. However, one inmediately realizes that the covering <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{U}\)</span> depends on the element <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, so this is not going to work.</p>
<h1 id="refinements" class="unnumbered">Refinements</h1>
<p>The way to solve this problem is by taking covering refinements. If <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{U}=\left\{ U_i: i \in I \right\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{V}=\left\{ V_j: j \in J \right\}\)</span> are two different open coverings of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, we say that <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{V}\)</span> is a <em>refinement</em> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{U}\)</span> is there is a map <span class="math inline">\(\tau:J\rightarrow I\)</span>, called the <em>refinement map</em>, such that <span class="math inline">\(V_j \subset U_{\tau(j)}\)</span> for every <span class="math inline">\(j \in J\)</span>.</p>
<p>A refinement map <span class="math inline">\(\tau:J \rightarrow I\)</span> naturally induces a map on <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-cochains <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
      \tau^* :C^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})&amp;\longrightarrow C^1(\mathfrak{V},\mathcal{F})\\ 
      (g_{ij})_{i&lt;j \in I} &amp;\longmapsto (g_{\tau(r)\tau(s)})_{r&lt;s \in J}. 
      \end{aligned}\]</span> (Note that for this to make sense the map <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> must be order-preserving, but since we are working with sheaves of groups, this can be solved by defining <span class="math inline">\(g_{ji}=(g_{ij})^{-1}\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(i&lt;j\)</span>.)</p>
<p>Moreover, clearly the map <span class="math inline">\(\tau^*\)</span> respects cocycles and thus induces a map <span class="math display">\[\tau^*:Z^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F}) \rightarrow Z^1(\mathfrak{V},\mathcal{F}).\]</span> This map clearly depends on the refinement map <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. However, if <span class="math inline">\(\eta: J \rightarrow I\)</span> is another refinement map, applying the cocycle condition we get <span class="math display">\[(\eta^*g)_{rs}= g_{\eta(r)\eta(s)}= g_{\eta(r)\tau(r)} g_{\tau(r)\eta(s)} = g_{\eta(r)\tau(r)} g_{\tau(r)\tau(s)} g_{\tau(s) \eta(s)}.\]</span> If we define the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-cochain <span class="math display">\[(f_r)_{r \in J} = (g_{\eta(r)\tau(r)})_{r\in J} \in C^0(\mathfrak{V},\mathcal{F}),\]</span> we have that <span class="math display">\[(\eta^*g)_{rs}=f_r (\tau^*g)_{rs} f_s^{-1}.\]</span></p>
<p>In general, for any open covering <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{U}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-cochains act on <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-cochains by “conjugation”: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    C^0(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\times C^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})&amp;\longrightarrow C^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\\ 
    ( (f_i)_{i\in I}, (g_{ij})_{i &lt;j \in I} )&amp;\longmapsto (f_i g_{ij} f_j^{-1})_{i &lt;j \in I}. 
    \end{aligned}\]</span> This action respects the cocycle condition and thus it gives an action of <span class="math inline">\(C^0(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Z^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\)</span>. The set of orbits is denoted as <span class="math inline">\(H^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\)</span> and it is called the <em>first Čech cohomology set of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{U}\)</span></em>.</p>
<p>Now it is clear that the map <span class="math inline">\(\tau^*\)</span> descends to cohomology <span class="math display">\[\tau^*: H^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\rightarrow H^1(\mathfrak{V},\mathcal{F})\]</span> and it does not depend on the choice of the refinement map <span class="math inline">\(\tau:J \rightarrow I\)</span>. These refinement maps form a direct system and we can take its direct limit to get the <em>first Čech cohomology set of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span></em>: <span class="math display">\[H^1(U,\mathcal{F})=\varinjlim_{\mathfrak{U}} H^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F}).\]</span> In other words, we consider the set of pairs <span class="math inline">\((\mathfrak{U},g)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{U}=\left\{ U_i,i\in I \right\}\)</span> is an open cover of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\in H^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\)</span> and consider on it the equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\((\mathfrak{U},g)\sim (\mathfrak{V},g&#39;)\)</span> if there exists another open cover <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{W}\)</span>, with refinements <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{U}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{W}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{V}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{W}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\tau^*g=\tau^*g&#39;\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, if we consider some element <span class="math inline">\(h\in \mathcal{H}(U)\)</span>, consider the open covering <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{U}=\left\{ U_i:i\in I \right\}\)</span> and the cocycle <span class="math inline">\((g_{ij})_{i&lt;j\in I}\)</span> constructed above, take its cohomology class, and then take its equivalence class in the direct limit, we get a map <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
      \delta:\mathcal{H}(U)&amp;\longrightarrow H^1(U,\mathcal{F})\\ 
      h &amp;\longmapsto [(\mathfrak{U},[(g_{ij})_{i&lt;j\in I}])]. 
      \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The set <span class="math inline">\(H^1(U,\mathcal{F})\)</span> has a distinguished element, the equivalence class of any of the distinguished elements of the cochains sets. It is now clear that <span class="math inline">\(\pi_U\)</span> will be surjective precisely when for every <span class="math inline">\(h\in \mathcal{H}(U)\)</span>, the class <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> can be represented by the cocycle <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in some open cover <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{U}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. This means that <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{im} \pi_U=\ker \delta\)</span>, and thus we get an exact sequence <span class="math display">\[\begin{CD}
    1 @&gt;&gt;&gt;  \mathcal{F}(U) @&gt; i_U &gt;&gt; \mathcal{G}(U) @&gt; \pi_U &gt;&gt; \mathcal{H}(U) @&gt;\delta &gt;&gt; H^1(U,\mathcal{F}).
      \end{CD}\]</span></p>
<h1 id="conclusion.-the-long-exact-sequence-in-cohomology" class="unnumbered">Conclusion. The long exact sequence in cohomology</h1>
<p>We have arrived naturally at cohomology as a means to continue the global exact sequence <span class="math inline">\(1\rightarrow \mathcal{F}(U) \rightarrow \mathcal{G}(U) \rightarrow \mathcal{H}(U)\)</span> induced by a short exact sequence <span class="math inline">\(1\rightarrow \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{G} \rightarrow \mathcal{H}\rightarrow 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Any morphism of sheaves <span class="math inline">\(\varphi:\mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{G}\)</span> naturally induces a map on <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-cochains <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        \varphi_*:C^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})&amp;\longrightarrow C^1(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\\ 
        (g_{ij})_{i&lt;j \in I} &amp;\longmapsto (\varphi_{U_i \cap U_j} (g_{ij}))_{i&lt;j \in I}. 
        \end{aligned}\]</span> This map descends well to cohomology and thus gives a map <span class="math display">\[\varphi_*:H^1(U,\mathcal{F}) \rightarrow H^1(U,\mathcal{G}).\]</span> It is easy to prove now that in fact this continues the above exact sequence to an exact sequence <span class="math display">\[1\rightarrow \mathcal{F}(U) \overset{i_U}{\rightarrow} \mathcal{G}(U) \overset{\pi_U}{\rightarrow} \mathcal{H}(U) \overset{\delta}{\rightarrow} H^1(U,\mathcal{F}) \overset{i_*}{\rightarrow} H^1(U,\mathcal{G}) \overset{\pi_*}{\rightarrow} H^1(U,\mathcal{H}).\]</span></p>
<p>In general, for any sheaf of sets <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>, Čech cochains can be defined for higher degree, <span class="math display">\[C^p(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})=\prod_{i_0&lt;\dots&lt;i_p} \mathcal{F}(U_{i_0} \cap \cdots \cap U_{i_p}).\]</span> However, a cocycle condition only makes sense when <span class="math inline">\(p&gt;1\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> is a sheaf of <em>abelian</em> groups. In this case, switching to additive notation, one can define a map <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
          d_p :C^{p-1}(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})&amp;\longrightarrow C^p(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F}) \\ 
          (g_{i_0,\dots,i_{p-1}})_{i_0&lt;\dots&lt;i_{p-1}\in I} &amp;\longmapsto \left( \sum_{k=0}^p (-1)^k g_{i_0,\dots,i_{k-1},i_{k+1},\dots,i_p}|_{U_{i_0} \cap \cdots U_{i_p}} \right)_{i_0&lt;\cdots&lt;i_p\in I}. 
          \end{aligned}\]</span> The kernel of <span class="math inline">\(d_p\)</span> is the set of <em>Čech <span class="math inline">\(p-1\)</span>-cocycles</em>, <span class="math inline">\(Z^{p-1}(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\)</span> and it contains the image of <span class="math inline">\(d_{p-1}\)</span>. The quotient <span class="math inline">\(Z^{p}(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})/\mathrm{im}(d_p)\)</span> is the <em><span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-th Čech cohomology group</em> <span class="math inline">\(H^p(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})\)</span>. As above, we can take limit by refinement to define <span class="math inline">\(H^p(U,\mathcal{F})\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider now the special case in which we have an exact sequence of sheaves of groups <span class="math inline">\(1\rightarrow \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{G} \rightarrow \mathcal{H} \rightarrow 1\)</span> such that, for any open subset <span class="math inline">\(U \subset X\)</span> the group <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(U)\)</span> is contained in the centre of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}(U)\)</span>. In this case the sheaf <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> must be a sheaf of abelian groups and thus <span class="math inline">\(H^2(U,\mathcal{F})\)</span> is defined. Moreover, in this case the exact sequence can be continued to a longer exact sequence <span class="math display">\[1\rightarrow \mathcal{F}(U) \overset{i_U}{\rightarrow} \mathcal{G}(U) \overset{\pi_U}{\rightarrow} \mathcal{H}(U) \overset{\delta}{\rightarrow} H^1(U,\mathcal{F}) \overset{i_*}{\rightarrow} H^1(U,\mathcal{G}) \overset{\pi_*}{\rightarrow} H^1(U,\mathcal{H}) \rightarrow H^2(U,\mathcal{F}).\]</span> The way to prove this is analogous to the construction of the map <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> is also a sheaf of abelian groups, then the three sheaves are. In this case it is well known that a long exact sequence that goes on forever can be constructed in the same way.</p>
<p>The treatement of cohomology we have given has been almost purely algebraic. However, there are a lot of geometric problems where these ideas are relevant. Moreover, the elements of <span class="math inline">\(H^1(X,\mathcal{F})\)</span> admit a very neat geometric interpretation as <em><span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>-torsors</em>. All these things will be treated in future posts.</p>
