### Master's and Bachelor's theses
+ **Master's Thesis**: *Higgs bundles twisted by a vector bundle*. Advisor: Oscar García-Prada

	+ **Abstract**: In this dissertation we explore a generalization of the theory of Higgs bundles over compact Riemann surfaces, in which the canonical line bundle is replaced by a vector bundle of arbitrary rank. This kind of situation appears naturally in the study of supersymmetric gauge theories. From the mathematical point of view, we study several topics: analogous of Hitchin's equations, stability, Hitchin--Kobayashi correspondence and a generalization of the spectral curve.

	+ **Keywords**: *Moduli space, vector bundle, Higgs bundle, Hitchin's equations, Hitchin--Kobayashi correspondence, Hitchin fibration, spectral curve*

	+ **Mathematical Subject Classification**: 14D20, 14D21, 14H60

+ **Mathematics Bachelor's Thesis**: *Introduction to Symplectic Geometry and Integrable Systems*. Advisor: Jesús M. Ruiz

	+ **Abstract**: The main goal of this work is to prove the Arnold--Liouville theorem, which gives a sufficient condition for a Hamiltonian mechanical system to be integrable by quadratures. To that end we define and develop the concepts involved in the theorem, giving some elementary notions of Symplectic Geometry and its application to Classical Mechanics.

+ **Physics Bachelor's Thesis**: *Superintegrable models: The Tremblay--Turbiner--Winternitz Hamiltonian*. Advisor: Miguel A. Rodríguez

	+ **Abstract**: This piece of work is an introduction to the theory of Integrable and Superintegrable Systems in Classical Mechanics. More precisely, we study the Tremblay--Turbiner--Winternitz Hamiltonian, proving its superintegrability, treating it in several coordinate systems and discussing its generalization to constant curvature spaces.
